2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Assigns descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Sets appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. Finally creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
